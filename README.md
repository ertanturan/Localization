The release package is installed and set for 3 languages : Turkish , English and Arabic . The installation process below is for the ones who would like to add more languages to their system .


1. Create `Assets/Resources/Data/Localization` folder if doesn't exists already.
2. Under Localization Folder >> Create 3 Folders named `AlphabetFontMatrix` , `Alphabets` and `Languages` if doesn't exits already.
3. Under Alphabets folder >> `Right click >> Create >> Localization >> Alphabet` (Create as many alphabets as you want).
4. Set RTL or LTR writing orientation for your language (RTL : Right to left , LTR : Left to right) .
5. Under `AlphabetFontMatrix` folder `>> Right click >> Create >> Localization >> AlphabetFontMatrix`
6. Set length according to your font variety . If you wish to use only 1 font for your whole project set length to 1 if more set it as you wish. 
(I'm assuming that you're using only one text font for your project.)
7. Set Latin font attribute to a font value which compatible for RTLTmpro asset . (typeof : TMP_FontAsset )
8. Set alphabet and its font in this matrix . (e.g. Latin Alphabet , MyriadPro-Regular SDF(TMP_FontAsset) ).
9. Under `Languages` folder `>> Right Click >> Create >> Localization >> Language` and set its Alphabet, Name , Icon and compatible system language text. (Repeat this step for as many language you would like to add in to your project.)

## Usage

1. Right `Click>>Create>>Localization>>(Language Dependent Text/Sprite/Video)`
2. Set size for your language dependent item (I used Language dependent text for demonstration). Size indicates how many language that your text gonna be able to be translated .
3. Drag and drop your previously created language items froum your resources folder (If can't be found please proceed to the installation above)
4. Set content for your text .
5. Head to your `hierarchy >> right click >> UI >> Text - RTLTMP >> Click add component >> Language text` .
